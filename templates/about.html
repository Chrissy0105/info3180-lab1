    <h1>Christina Blye</h1>
    <p>
      I am a first-year Information Technology student who enjoys learning about
      cybersecurity, networking, and programming. I love exploring how systems
      work, solving technical problems, and building small projects that improve
      my skills. My main interests include data science, ethical hacking, and
      computer networks, and I hope to pursue a future career as a cybersecurity
      analyst where I can help protect systems and data.
