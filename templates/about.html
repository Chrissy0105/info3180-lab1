<h1>Christina Blye</h1>
<p>I am a first-year Information Technology student who enjoys learning about cybersecurity, networking, and programming. I love exploring how systems work, solving technical problems, and building small projects that improve my skills. My main interests include data science, ethical hacking, and computer networks, and I hope to pursue a future career as a cybersecurity analyst where I can help protect systems and data.</p>
